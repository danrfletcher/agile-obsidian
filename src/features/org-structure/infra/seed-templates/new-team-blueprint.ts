 * Blueprint for new team folder structure and sample content.

 * Rules applied by createTeamResources/materializeBlueprint:
 * - "Docs" folder is created as-is.
 * - "Initiatives" folder is renamed to include slug.
 * - Markdown files inside "Initiatives" are renamed to include slug, and a few known stems
 *   ("Completed", "Initiatives", "Priorities") use explicit naming helpers.
