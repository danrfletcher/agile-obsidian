/**
 * Blueprint for new team folder structure and sample content.
 * This is used for both regular teams (empty content) and the Sample Team (pre-populated content).
 *
 * Rules applied by createTeamResources/materializeBlueprint:
 * - By default, all folders and files are renamed to include the slug.
 * - You can disable slug renaming per node with `renameWithSlug: false`. This setting
 *   is inherited by children unless they explicitly set their own flag.
 * - "Initiatives" folder and its known files ("Completed", "Initiatives", "Priorities")
 *   use explicit naming helpers to preserve exact casing and conventions.
 *
 * Content source:
 * - We import sample markdown content from collocated files so itâ€™s easy to edit.
 * - Ensure your bundler (esbuild) has a loader configured for .md: loader: { ".md": "text" }.
